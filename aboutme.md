Welcome to my corner of the internet, allow me to introduce myself and share my story with you.


### Who am I?
A Londoner who lived in Paris and worked as a DevOps engineer for 3 years, (every company has its own definition), with experience that overlaps with Site Reliability Engineering and Platform Engineering. During this time, agile methodologies and tools such as Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Gitlab ci and Argo CD were used. At university I studied computer science and finished with a masters degree. My journey in DevOps began when I moved to France in 2020 to join a crash simulation software company called [Engineering Systems International](https://www.esi-group.com/) (ESI) and a few years after I joined FinTech [Swan](https://www.swan.io/). During those years, I worked on performance and reliability enhancing projects that have shaped my perspective and fueled my passion for DevOps/SRE.

Some of the projects include:
- Automating the collection of source code (to be sent to an independent third party for intellectual property protection)
- The automation of installer creation for parts of the crash simulation software suite at ESI
- Migration of tens of thousands of tickets from Jira on premise to Jira cloud (great exposure to APIs and data migration)
- Creating an antivirus service for objects placed in S3 buckets with deletion of detected viruses and alerting via email



### What drives me?
What most sets my interests alight is user impact. Knowing that the work you do directly impacts end-users and customers is a powerful motivator.  The opportunity to automate repetitive tasks, streamline processes, and increase efficiency is another key motivator. Whether it's ensuring the reliability, performance or security of a system, or automating a mundane task, I am deeply committed to contributing to a positive user experience. 

### My hobbies and interests
- Piano
- Chess
- Golf
- Hackathons
- Sports (golf, skiing, running, football and recently basketball)

My newly wedded wife and I have a dog (well it's more hers than mine 😄), a chihuahua called Leika.
