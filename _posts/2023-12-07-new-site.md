Partly because I enjoy the benefits of teaching (at university I was a teaching assistant to first and second year students), it feels good to share what I know. It also helps to give myself a reality check because if I can't explain it then I probably don't understand it well enough.

I'll use this site as a space to keep adding posts on some of what I've learnt or indeed re-learnt, to also act as a reminder for myself at some point in the future.

Though it'll be primarily about development, cloud infrastructure,pipeline creation and other DevOps related subjects, I have written a bit [about myself](https://davidlight.io/aboutme/) to help you know me a little better.
