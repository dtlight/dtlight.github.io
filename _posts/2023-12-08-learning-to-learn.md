Most of my posts will be technical ones but the objective of this post is to highlight the art of learning to learn. 

As someone who always tried and failed at speaking any second language, I went from zero to conversational in about 18 months and from conversational to completely fluent in 3 years. This experience taught me about learning efficiently, persevering and making the most of being thrown in at the deep end.

For many, 2020 was a year of isolation owing to the covid-19 pandemic, so further isolating myself by moving to France on my own during that pandemic, was something out of my comfort zone to say the least. It was on one hand exciting to leave my comfort zone, to experience a different culture, to be able to make the most of an unexpected opportunity to work abroad and the ease of working in the EU before Brexit was finalised. On the other hand, apart from bonjour and a handful of other incredibly basic words, I’d never spoken French before. France isn’t known for its prowess in English and I now understand why. Administrative processes like visa requests, social security, banking and taxes will all be conducted in French with little pity if you can’t speak it. I met a handful of English speakers who'd been living in France for five or even ten years and couldn't speak much if any French, "how do they cope?" I wondered. What I did understand was that living in another country alone doesn't automatically guarantee learning to speak a language. 

One of the best analogies I read was that of learning a language being compared to climbing a mountain... with thick slippery ice all around the bottom. Most people give up at this point because it is in a way the hardest part. You have no traction, no momentum and above all you have the false expectation that it will never get easier. In the beginning, motivation to get started plus perseverance to keep going is key. Every time I had hit a language barrier at the post office, the bank, the hospital or the dentist, I was also hit with a fresh wave of motivation to learn this seemingly impossible language. I used this motivation to get up at 6 or 7am every week day morning to have an hour call with a French tutor before starting work at 8am. I realised that if I studied after work then nothing would sink in, I definitely learn better in the morning. This motivation coupled with the discipline turned into the perseverance I needed to get through one year of early morning French lessons. It also helped that I had a highly enthusiastic [French teacher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fanny-porte-drougard/) who really made the morning calls more desirable. University taught me something about learning but this experience has been wholly different.

Summary: 
I learnt how to turn my language barrier frustration into motivation, I had a constant daily reminder to teach myself and to practice (solely 5 hours a week of lessons won’t be enough). I tried different resources and techniques but ultimately discovering the benefits of spaced repetition is what helped the most. 

When I gave myself no other choice, forward became the only option.
